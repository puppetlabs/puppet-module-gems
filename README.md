## Description

Puppet Module Gems is a utility that generates gemspecs and builds management gems based on a YAML-based configuration. The purpose for these gems is to reduce the amount of changes required to sync shared dependencies across multiple modulesâ€™ Gemfiles.

For example, when a dependency gem publishes a new release that requires Ruby 2.3.3, this would normally break all modules that install this gem that run on a version of Ruby less than 2.3.3. To fix this previously, you would need a modulesync to pin the gem to a compatible version. With these new gem management gems, you can instead update the gem version pin in a configuration YAML. The gem management will then build and publish to rubygems, and a bundle update fixes all affected modules.

## Setup

### Setup Requirements

* Requires Ruby version 2.0 or greater
* Requires RubyGems gem version 2.0 or greater
* Requires Bundler gem version 1.3.0 or greater

## Usage

To get started using this utility, first clone this git repository:

`git clone git@github.com:puppetlabs/puppet-module-gems.git`

Install the development gems:

`bundle install`

### Building the gems

To build the gems with the default configuration, execute the script `bundle exec exe/puppet-module-gems.rb`. The gemspec files and gems will be generated in the `pkg` directory.

### Customizing dependency gems

To build customized dependency gems, you simply need to modify the config yamls prior to running the script.

First modify the `config/info.yml` to customize the prefix for your gem names, in addition to the rest of the required information. Secondly, you will need to modify the `config/dependencies.yml` to customize the dependency matrix to suit your needs. After defining these customizations, you can build your gems with the directions detailed in [Building the gems](#building-the-gems).

### Using generated gems

To use the resulting gems, replace the sections of the Module Gemfile with the appropriate gems and conditions.

For Example:

```
group :development do
  gem 'puppet-lint',                        :require => false
  gem 'metadata-json-lint',                 :require => false, :platforms => 'ruby'
  gem 'puppet_facts',                       :require => false
  gem 'puppet-blacksmith', '>= 3.4.0',      :require => false, :platforms => 'ruby'
  gem 'puppetlabs_spec_helper', '>= 1.2.1', :require => false
  gem 'rspec-puppet', '>= 2.3.2',           :require => false
  gem 'rspec-puppet-facts',                 :require => false, :platforms => 'ruby'
  gem 'mocha', '< 1.2.0',                   :require => false
  gem 'simplecov',                          :require => false, :platforms => 'ruby'
  gem 'rubocop',                            :require => false
  gem 'pry',                                :require => false
  gem 'rainbow', '< 2.2.0',                 :require => false
end

group :system_tests do
  gem 'beaker-puppet_install_helper',                                            :require => false
  gem 'beaker-module_install_helper',                                            :require => false
  gem 'master_manipulator',                                                      :require => false
end
```

The above Gemfile section would become:

```
group :development do
  gem 'puppet-module-posix-dev-r2.1' if Gem::Version.new(RUBY_VERSION.dup) < Gem::Version.new('2.3.0')
  gem 'puppet-module-posix-dev-r2.3' if Gem::Version.new(RUBY_VERSION.dup) >= Gem::Version.new('2.3.0')
end

group :system_tests do
  gem 'puppet-module-posix-system-r2.1' if Gem::Version.new(RUBY_VERSION.dup) < Gem::Version.new('2.3.0')
  gem 'puppet-module-posix-system-r2.3' if Gem::Version.new(RUBY_VERSION.dup) >= Gem::Version.new('2.3.0')
end
```

After this update, the subsequent `bundle install` or `bundle update` would pull in the new gems and the dependencies should reflect the correct version bindings based on the Ruby version. Any future gems and version pinning that may be needed can be done via publishing updated management gems.

## Reference

### Configuration Files

#### info.yml

**Reserved Keys**

 * `info` - Details the start of the information block. Required.
 * `prefix` - Indicates the prefix to use for the generated gems. Required.

**Required Keys**

 * `authors` - String. The author of these gems.
 * `email` - String. Email address of the author.
 * `homepage` - String. Homepage for the gem project.
 * `licenses` - String. License to publish gems under.
 * `summary` - String. Brief description of what the gem does.
 * `version` - String. Version of these gems.

#### dependencies.yml

**Reserved Keys**

 * `dependencies` - Details the start of the dependencies block. Required.
 * `shared` - Details the shared dependencies amongst the keys within the same tier.
 * `gem` - Details the name of the gem dependency to add. Required.
 * `version` - Details the version bindings for the gem listed in preceding `gem`.

**Example**

```YAML
dependencies:
  shared:
    a:
      - gem: shared-gem
        version: '> 1.0.0'
  first:
    a:
      - gem: a-gem-one
    b:
      - gem: b-gem-one
        version: '< 2.0.0`
  second:
    b:
      - gem: b-gem-two
```

The above dependency matrix will generate this list of gems if the defined prefix is `test-gem` with version `1.0.0`:

- test-gem-first-a-1.0.0.gem
- test-gem-first-b-1.0.0.gem
- test-gem-second-a-1.0.0.gem
- test-gem-second-b-1.0.0.gem

And for example, the gemspec for `test-gem-first-a-1.0.0.gem` will include dependencies of:

- shared-gem, '> 1.0.0'
- a-gem-one
